# Blueprint Signals  
[CHANGELOG](changelog.txt) | [MIT License](LICENSE) | https://github.com/Haxtorio/BlueprintSignals  

Blueprint Signals will read a blueprint and convert it to a set of constant combinators containing
the signals and values of the blueprint items. The combinators can then be connected to a circuit
or logistic network to request the blueprint items for construction.

This is an addon mod that fully integrates with BlueprintExtensions if it is installed. It
will also work fine as a stand-alone mod if you don't have or want Blueprint Extensions.


## Instructions  
While holding a valid blueprint (that is not empty), press `CTRL+ALT+S` to convert it.  
A set of one or more constant combinators will be generated containing all the unique signals for
the blueprint items and counts.
